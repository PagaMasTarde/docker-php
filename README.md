##### docker-compose example for Symfony4 project

here is a docker-compose example, have in mind you need to create docker/vhost inside
your project. You can use the example vhost in this repository under /config/project-name.conf

Keep in mind this is a default VHOST for a symfony 4 project but you should be able to
adapt it to your own needs.

```bash
version: "3.3"
services:
  project-name:
    ports:
      - "8055:80" //On the left the port that will be exposed
    volumes:
      - "./:/var/www/project-name:rw" //Mount files to container
      - "./docker/vhost:/etc/apache2/sites-enabled" //link VHOST to apache
    image: pagantis/docker-php:7.2
    working_dir: /var/www/project-name
    environment:
        ENVIRONMENT: dev
```
